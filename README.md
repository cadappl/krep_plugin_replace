The tool provides a simple way with [krep] to replace the file contexts with
the XML config file containing `value-sets` elements.
 
It involves `subcmds`, the variable `KREP_EXTRA_PATH` need to be set to point
to the location of the git.

```sh
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└─── subcmds
     └── replace_subcmd.py
```

The more details of the sub-commands can be referred with the command
`krep help` and the help output of the sub-commands.
